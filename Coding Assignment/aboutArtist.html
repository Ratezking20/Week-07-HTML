            <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Lesean Devonn grew up in the inner city of Minneapolis, MN. Growing up and thriving through the streets of the Northside, Lesean was <br>surrounded by musical influence in the most important places. He always looked for inspiration in 
                the people around him <br>to make great records along with his brother and cousin.
                <br><br> Eager to become successful as a Hip Hop artist, Lesean Devonn began to get a job to fund his music career where he a nearly lost his life. <br>
                He had no idea if he would be able to sing or rap again, and was unsure about his future in music.
                With insult to injury, Lesean Devonn <br>felt compelled to put his motivation to heal and get better into his music.<br><br> He wants fans to know that if they've fallen, that they can get back up and make things happen from seemingly impossible situations.
